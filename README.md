🎙️ AI Desktop Voice Assistant

## Overview

The AI Desktop Voice Assistant, named Jarvis, is a Python-based virtual assistant that can understand voice commands, perform tasks, and provide information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Recognition. This project enhances user productivity by automating common desktop tasks through voice commands.


## Features

   🗣️ Voice Recognition: Converts spoken language into text using SpeechRecognition.
   
   🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS): Provides voice responses using Edge TTS and pygame.
   
   🖥️ Task Automation: Opens applications, searches the web, fetches weather updates, and more.
   
   🤖 Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses Google Gemini AI for advanced query handling.
   
   🔍 Web Search: Searches Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube based on voice queries.
   
   🎭 Joke Generation: Fetches and speaks random jokes.
   
   ⚙️ Customizable Commands: Easily extendable to support additional functionalities.




## Technologies Used

   🐍 Python (Core logic and scripting)
   
   🎙️ SpeechRecognition (For voice input processing)
   
   🗣️ pyttsx3 / Edge TTS (Text-to-speech conversion)
   
   🎧 PyAudio (Audio input handling)
   
   📚 Wikipedia API (For fetching information from Wikipedia)
   
   🤖 Google Gemini AI (For NLP and conversational responses)
   
   🔎 pywhatkit (For YouTube and Google searches)
