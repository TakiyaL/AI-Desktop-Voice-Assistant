# AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
Overview

The AI Desktop Voice Assistant, named Jarvis, is a Python-based virtual assistant that can understand voice commands, perform tasks, and provide information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Recognition. This project aims to enhance user productivity by automating common desktop tasks through voice commands.

Features

Voice Recognition: Converts spoken language into text using SpeechRecognition.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Provides voice responses using Edge TTS and pygame.

Task Automation: Opens applications, searches the web, fetches weather updates, and more.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses Google Gemini AI for advanced query handling.

Web Search: Searches Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube based on voice queries.

Customizable Commands: Easily extendable to support additional functionalities.

Joke Generation: Fetches and speaks random jokes.

Technologies Used

Python (Core logic and scripting)

SpeechRecognition (For voice input processing)

pyttsx3 / Edge TTS (Text-to-speech conversion)

PyAudio (Audio input handling)

Wikipedia API (For fetching information from Wikipedia)

Google Gemini AI (For NLP and conversational responses)

pywhatkit (For YouTube and Google searches)

pyautogui (For UI automation)

pygame (For audio playback)

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.

Steps to Install

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant.git
cd AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the assistant:

python main.py

Usage

Run the script and speak commands into your microphone.

The assistant will process the command and respond accordingly.

Example commands:

"Jarvis, open Notepad"

"What is the time?"

"Search Wikipedia for Artificial Intelligence"

"Tell me a joke"

"Play my music"

Future Enhancements

Improved AI model integration for better NLP understanding.

More automation commands for enhanced usability.

GUI-based interface for non-voice interactions.
